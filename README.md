# Data-Analytics-Lifecycle-Customer-Churn-Prediction
<h4>Project Description & Objectives</h4>
<p>Customer churn analysis is a crucial process for businesses aiming to retain customers by identifying reasons for churn and predicting at-risk customers. This project leverages machine learning to develop a predictive model that can forecast customer churn based on behavioral and transactional data. The primary objectives of this project include:
Analyzing customer churn patterns to understand key factors influencing customer retention.
Developing a machine learning-based model to predict customer churn.
Creating an interactive interface for users to test the model with real-time inputs.
Providing insights into actionable strategies for reducing churn.</p>
<h4>Methodology and Technology Used</h4>
<p> The project follows a structured approach, which includes: 
<b>Data Collection: </b>Utilizing a publicly available dataset containing customer demographic, behavioral, and service usage details.
<b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
<b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Understanding data distribution through visualization techniques.
<b>Model Development:</b> Implementing a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn.
<b>Model Evaluation:</b> Measuring model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
<b>User Interface Development:</b> Creating an interactive interface using Pythonâ€™s ipywidgets for easy accessibility.

  <h5> Technologies used:</h5>
<b>Python</b> (for programming and machine learning implementation)
<b>Pandas, NumPy </b>(for data manipulation and preprocessing)
<b>Matplotlib, Seaborn </b>(for data visualization)
<b>Scikit-learn</b> (for model training and evaluation)
<b>ipywidgets</b> (for building an interactive user interface)</p>
